				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>There is no doubt that a GRC team is critical and instrumental in bridging the gap between the business and IT (or any other department that takes on the implementation of GRC processes and automation). They are the messengers, not the managers of business processes. They are independent, and ideally span horizontally across many business functions, including IT.</p>
<p>As previously discussed, GRC, though normally referred to as just a platform, is much more in principle. It is a business enabler, and requires careful planning to ensure that it thrives across all business functions, not just IT.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Similar to IT, HR, and other departments, the GRC team is best suited to bridge executive leadership with each of the business functions to:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<ul class="tick">
<li data-aria-posinset="1" data-aria-level="2">Ensure Alignment of business functions with strategic directives</li>
<li data-aria-posinset="2" data-aria-level="2">Provide visibility to business stakeholders in terms of their unique perspectives (example: Compliance team wanting a report on adherence to PCI or HIPAA)</li>
<li data-aria-posinset="3" data-aria-level="2">Measure and report performance of each business function as it a</li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>GRC typically does not belong, nor does it prosper when placed under the IT organization. For it to be truly effective as a shared service, it must understand each business function that it works with, and cater to their needs.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Ultimately, the implementation and customization of a GRC platform lies with the IT organization, but that is a very limited scope of GRC as a function.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Now lets talk about automation of GRC, and this is the part where the majority of the industry &#8220;pundits&#8221; are typically focused on.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Consider the set of processes that a GRC team executes on a day to day basis. In the absence of a robust automation platform, it is a lot of work with countless moving parts that keep changing the risk and compliance posture at the speed of business. Human error could easily lead to inaccurate reporting of business alignment and performance back to the executive leadership.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>It is understood that if these GRC processes are not yielding results as intended, either because they are outdated, or simply inaccurate or incomplete, then automation of these processes would not fix such foundational issues and the implementation would not yield expected results.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Make no mistake that if GRC processes are not effective, automation will follow the logic of &#8220;garbage in, garbage out&#8221;.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>So when an organization embarks on implementation of a GRC automation platform,  the first step that ought to be taken is to ensure that GRC processes are effective (complete, accurate, up to date). Then proceed with the implementation.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Once the likes of RSA Archer, Lockpath Keylight, ServiceNow, etc., are implemented, a GRC team can quickly start to gain operational efficiencies, and that is, the true business value of GRC automation.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The business value of GRC is to provide business leaders with intelligence to ensure that the organization is reaping the rewards of investments in their Risk and Compliance initiatives as directed and planned.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>So a GRC team is literally receiving its directives from the executive management, collecting relevant data from the Risk and Compliance capabilities (in place) and initiatives (in motion), and rolling it back up to the executive branch, highlighting status, performance, issues, and opportunities for review and action.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The function of GRC, if strategically placed, aligned, and managed within an organization, allows the executive leadership to make data-driven decisions with agility and at the pace of business.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Generally speaking, the &#8220;function&#8221; of GRC as it may be performed by a group of individuals in an organization, is to act as a bridge between business and IT, managing fulfilment of business objectives and expectations on one end, while culminating data and information on the other end, in order to evaluate and report back on the performance of the functions of Risk and Compliance, back to the governing body.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In a typical organization, generally at an operational maturity level of 2.5 or below (reference: Gartner service maturity model), there is usually a clearly defined management layer and a clearly defined operational layer. However, the governance function is either loosely defined, not separated from the management function, or even completely missing. Then again, there are always exceptions to this general observation.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>From an organizational placement perspective, the function of GRC has a better chance of prospering if it&#8217;s not placed under the IT organization, rather, a business entity that is tasked with managing organizational performance and risk management.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>As we all know, governance is an executive management function (ISO 38500: Evaluate, Direct, Monitor), and since we are focused on the topics of risk and compliance within the context of GRC, the true meaning of GRC is really about ensuring the presence of an effective governance layer for an organization to manage its risk and compliance portfolios.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Refer to article titled &#8220;<a href="./../2018/09/22/73295/index.html">GRC Definitions and Acronyms</a>&#8221; for details.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>From a business perspective, GRC is a business function that has three distinct purposes:</p>
<ul class="tick">
<li data-aria-posinset="1" data-aria-level="2">Evaluation of business context (both internal and external) in order for executive leadership to set the strategic direction for the business</li>
<li data-aria-posinset="2" data-aria-level="2">Dissemination of business directives to operational teams for management of business functions</li>
<li data-aria-posinset="3" data-aria-level="2">Monitoring, measurement, and reporting of business performance of each function back to the executive leadership to ascertain alignment, visibility, and performance of each function</li>
</ul>
<p>Simply speaking, GRC is so much more than just the platform acronym. It is a means to ensure alignment, provide visibility, and measure performance of business as it relates to board-level directives.</p>
